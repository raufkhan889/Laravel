Whenever you move your laravel project the plugin will not autoload 
so in order to fix this issue, you can run following command:

---------------------------------------------------------------

Step - 1:
install composer 

// this is going to discover/autoload all the plugin 


Step - 2:
php artisan key:generate 

// this will generate a new .ENV key 

---------------------------------------------------------------- 

After that you can run your laravel prject, and your are good to go! :)
